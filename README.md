# Id-card-scanner
An identification card is a card that contains a person's name, photograph, date of birth, and other personal information. 
It aids in the determination of a person's identification.
Companies issue ID cards to their employees. To get access to enter a college, students must present an ID card. 
This ensures the organization's safety and security by allowing only authorized personnel to access the facility.
An ID Scanner alleviates the need for a human to manually check the data.
In this project, we intend to create an ID card Scanner. The ID card is scanned, and the information on it is segmented using OCR. 
The information scanned from the ID card can thus be used to determine whether or not a person is authenticated to enter the college.
